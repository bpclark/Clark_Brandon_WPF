Problem 1- A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed

Define the Problem:

The problem here is that we can not leave the cat, parrot alone or bag of seed and the parrot alone  to get to the other side of the river.

The man will have to move the parrot back and forth a couple of times to solve this riddle.

The overall goal is to get the parrot, cat and seed all to the other side of the river.


Break the problem apart:

We have been limited to the number of items the man can carry accross the river. Yet we cannot leave the cat and parrot alone, nor can we leave the parrot and the seed alone.

If the cat is alone with the parrot it will eat the parrot and if the parrot is alone with the seed then it will it that. So keep them seperate and make multiple trips with the parrot back and forth.
